pmfindex
========

Poor Man's File Indexer, it creates html pages containing links of resources like .avi, .mp3, .pdf that are spread on the disks. No need for searches&amp;dives into deep folders, all files of one type in your computer listed and sorted in one single page. Put the script in /usr/bin, go to the root of whatever you want to index and run: $ pmfindex  (sudo if you index folders of other users)
